# Twitter-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

This project analyzes tweets and the existence of racist/sexist content in these tweets. This project utilized Logistic Regression to predict the existence of racist/sexist language in different tweets collected. 

Using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF feature extraction techniques, our model shows to have a slightly higher accuracy with TF-IDF. This is perhaps due to the higher frequencies of positive words on Twitter, allowing 
TF-IDF to perform more appropriately.
